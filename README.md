# Tonci's Portfolio Website 🚀

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my portfolio repo. I've packed this site with all the cool stuff I've been doing in software testing and QA. Let's dive in!

## Check It Out Live! 🌐

Take it for a spin at [https://tonciz.github.io/](https://tonciz.github.io/)

## What's This All About? 🤔

This is my digital playground where I show off my professional journey, tech skills, and some neat case studies. I wanted to keep things clean and responsive while highlighting what I can bring to the table in the testing world.

## How I Built This (Spoiler: Super Fast!) ⚡

I whipped this whole thing up in just a few hours using some awesome AI-powered tools:

- **Cursor IDE** - This thing is magical! AI-powered coding at my fingertips
- **Warp Terminal** - Makes command line stuff way less painful
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** - My AI pair programmer that helped generate code
- **AI Prompting** - Turns out I'm pretty good at talking to robots 🤖

Here's what I focused on:
1. Making the nav work on all devices without being a pain
2. Creating a sweet timeline that actually makes sense
3. Making sure everything looks good no matter the screen size
4. Keeping the code clean (future me says thanks!)
5. Adding some JavaScript pizzazz for animations and cool effects

## The Cool Stuff 💫

- Navigation that doesn't break when you resize your browser (it happens more than you'd think)
- A timeline that tells my story without making your eyes hurt
- Clean, modern vibes throughout the site
- Mobile-first approach because phones exist
- Fast loading (nobody likes waiting)
- Smooth transitions and animations powered by JS
- Interactions that make the site feel alive

## Tech I Used 🛠️

- **HTML5** - Because we all need structure in our lives
- **CSS3** - Making things pretty with fancy techniques
- **JavaScript** - Adding that interactive magic
- **Responsive Design** - It works everywhere, promise!
- **Git** - Keeping track of all my brilliant (and not so brilliant) changes
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting? Yes please!

## What You'll Find 📋

- A home page that doesn't put you to sleep
- A timeline of my career that actually flows nicely
- A breakdown of my skills with some interactive elements
- Case studies that show I know what I'm doing
- A contact form that actually works (with JS validation!)
- A grid of testing tools and tech I know my way around

## The Build Process 🏗️

This site lives on GitHub Pages with a clean, content-focused design. The whole process showed me how powerful it is to combine AI tools with my own expertise in web design and development.

## The AI Dream Team 🤖

- **Cursor IDE**: Code completion that feels like it's reading my mind
- **Warp Terminal**: Making terminal work feel less like 1985
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: My AI assistant that writes pretty decent code
- **GitHub Pages**: Deployment so easy it feels like cheating

This project is proof that AI tools can seriously speed up web development while still keeping everything high-quality and following best practices. The robots aren't taking our jobs - they're just making them way more fun!
